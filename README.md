* Project idea site - can post just ideas, and then others can expand them into full projects (with source control, wiki, etc.).
* Thumb up an idea if you like it (Digg-style), or post a bounty
  - we take percentage of bounty if it is either fulfilled, or retracted after mediation (no loss if no one claims it)
