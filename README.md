* Project idea site - can post just ideas, and then others can expand them into full projects (with source control, wiki, etc.).
* Thumb up an idea if you like it (Digg-style), or post a bounty
  - we take percentage of bounty if it is either fulfilled, or retracted after mediation (no loss if no one claims it)
  - can post ideas with bounty (minimum of $1).  Others would be able to fulfill that bounty and gather the payment.  Good way to get small bits of work done, or even large projects where many people can collect upon one bounty.
